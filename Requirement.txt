install all libaries mentioned below:

scipy (pip install scipy)

We’ll need the SciPy package so we can compute the Euclidean distance between facial landmarks points in the eye aspect ratio calculation (not strictly a requirement, but you should have SciPy installed if you intend on doing any work in the computer vision, image processing, or machine learning space).
OpenCv

openCv for computer vision
numpy (pip install numpy)

numpy for basic processing and calcutions ...
imutils (pip install imutils)

We’ll also need the imutils package, my series of computer vision and image processing functions to make working with OpenCV easier.
pyglet (pip install pyglet)

we'll also need pyglet playing sound such as .mp3 , .wav ...
dlib

To detect and localize facial landmarks we’ll need the dlib library
